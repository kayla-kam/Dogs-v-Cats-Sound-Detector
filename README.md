# Dogs-v-Cats-Sound-Detector
I created a model that recognizes the differences between a cat's meow and a dog's barking. By converting it through a spectrogram and then eventually a STFT, tensorflow is used to be able to understand what the different audios look like. As a result, it prints out which animal it thinks it is based on the audio and displays a picture.
